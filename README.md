# Unofficial documentation of unofficial fixes and tweaks to comma and unofficial openpilot hardware

The [comma.ai Discord][cdiscord] isn't really a good place to store _answers_ to questions about repairing the hardware.
Discord's search is terrible, and the content inside of it isn't accessible to search engines.
This is an attempt to document some of the common issues and fixes that were discussed in the Discord.

This may also include links to other non-comma.ai Discords as well.
